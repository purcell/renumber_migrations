RenumberMigrations
==================

Automatically renumber new local migrations when their numbers clash with
team-mates' migrations updated from a subversion repository.

The plugin's home on the web is here:

Examples
========

You're working on migration 045_add_my_new_feature.rb, when one of your team-mates checks
045_some_other_migration.rb into svn.  You notice the numbering clash (or 'rake db:migrate'
notices it for you), and you simply run the db:migrate:renumber task:

% rake db:migrate:renumber

Voil√° - your migration is renumbered to 046, and the database schema is left at version
044 ready for you to re-test your migration.


Requirements
============

Note that renumbering a migration *requires* that you have a working #down method for
your migration.

Renumbering also requires that you have network access to the subversion server, since
clashing migrations are temporarily removed locally, and later re-requested.
